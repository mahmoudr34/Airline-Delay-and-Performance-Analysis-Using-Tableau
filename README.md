# Airline Delay and Performance Analysis Using Tableau

## Overview
This project analyzes U.S. airline flight delay data to evaluate airline performance, aircraft-level delays, and the relationship between flight distance and departure delays. Interactive dashboards were developed using Tableau to support exploratory and business-focused analysis.

## Business Objectives
- Identify airlines with the highest average departure delays
- Analyze primary causes of flight cancellations
- Evaluate aircraft-level performance beyond airline-level averages
- Examine the relationship between flight distance and delays

## Tools Used
- Tableau Public (interactive dashboards)
- Excel (data preparation)
- GitHub (documentation)

## Key Insights

### Airline Performance and Cancellations
- NK Airlines recorded the highest average departure delay (17.37 minutes)
- Weather accounts for 54% of flight cancellations
- Arrival delays are approximately 50% lower than departure delays, indicating effective mitigation strategies

### Aircraft Performance Analysis
- Aircraft N389AA and N354AA showed significantly higher average delays
- Aircraft-level analysis reveals performance issues that airline-level averages can mask

### Distance and Delay Correlation
- A weak positive relationship exists between flight distance and departure delays (R² = 0.047)
- Distance has minimal impact on delays compared to operational factors
